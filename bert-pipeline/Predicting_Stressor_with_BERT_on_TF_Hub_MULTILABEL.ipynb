    "Intro:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve been following Natural Language Processing over the past year, you’ve probably heard of BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It’s a neural network architecture designed by Google researchers that’s totally transformed what’s state-of-the-art for NLP tasks, like text classification, translation, summarization, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that BERT's been added to [TF Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) as a loadable module, it's easy(ish) to add into existing Tensorflow text pipelines. In an existing pipeline, BERT can replace text embedding layers like ELMO and GloVE. Alternatively, [finetuning](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Fine_tuning) BERT can provide both an accuracy boost and faster training time in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some code was adapted from [this colab notebook](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/tensorflow/tpu/blob/master/tools/colab/bert_finetuning_with_cloud_tpus.ipynb). Let's get started!"
